Simple definitions / explanations for the output from the ds3 driver programs:

et= elapsed time  
n_overall= number of overall completed orders
opm= orders per minute 
rt_tot_lastn_max_msec= maximum response time in the last n orders 
rt_tot_avg_msec= response time average 
rt_tot_sampled= response time average in the last sample interval
rollbacks: 
n= number of database transactions that were rolled back due to insufficient inventory  
%=  percentage of orders that were rollbacks
