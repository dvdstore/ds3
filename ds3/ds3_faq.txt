1. Can you please elaborate a little on the parameters to the utility. (I am
specifically interested in S/M/L db size and think time)

S/M/L refer to the size of the database (10 MB/ 1 GB/ 100 GB). Things like
maximum number of products and customers are tied to the size. Think time is
the time between requests, while the simulated user is reading the previous
response and "thinking". You can set it to a value you think is
realistic (10 seconds?, 2 seconds?) and use this to estimate the number of
total supported users. Or you can set it to 0 and have the program drive the
backend as hard as possible for a measurement of total throughput (orders per
minute). Or you can adjust it if you are trying to drive an arbitrary number
of orders per minute.


2. Is the number of threads is equivalent to number of users ? 

Number of threads is the number of connections to back end (web server or
database). If you set think time to a realistic value (as discussed in
question 1) then threads will be equal to users.


3. What is the difference between starting the prog with 10 threads from
a single machine compared to 5 threads from two different machine.

Unless you are hitting a resource bottleneck (either the client CPU or
networking) you shouldn't see much difference.


4. How do I interpret the data obtained from the ds3webdriver utility. (I
mean For example : et=  100.0 n_overall=280 opm=168 rt_tot_lastn_max=298
rt_tot_avg=115 rollbacks: n=121 %= 43.2)

See ./ds3/drivers/ds3_driver.txt

5. Is it fair to compare the DS3 database size (10 MB /1 GB/100 GB) with
no of warehouses in TPCC ? 

No
