1. Introduction

The DVD Store Version 3 (DS3) is a complete open source online e-commerce test
application, with a backend database component, a web application
layer, and driver programs.  The goal in designing the database
component as well as the midtier application was to utilize many
advanced database features (transactions, stored procedures, triggers,
referential integity) while keeping the database easy to install and
understand. The DS3 workload may be used to test databases or as a
stress tool for any purpose.

The distribution will include code for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and PostGres.
Included in the release are data generation programs, shell scripts to 
build data for any size DVD Store database as well as three standard sizes, 
database build scripts and stored procedure, PHP web pages, and a C# driver program.
Load data for the small DVD Store database is included in the kit.

The DS3 files are separated into database-independent data load files
under ./ds3/data_files and driver programs under ./ds3/drivers
and database-specific build scripts, loader programs, and driver
programs in directories
./ds3/mysqlds3
./ds3/oracleds3
./ds3/sqlserverds3
./ds3/pgsqlds3

The DVD Store kit is available at github.com/dvdstore

file ds3.tar.gz contains ./ds3/data_files and ./ds3/drivers
file ds3_mysql.tar.gz contains ./ds3/mysqlds3
file ds3_oracle.tar.gz contains ./ds3/oracleds3
file ds3_sqlserver.tar.gz contains ./ds3/sqlserverds3
file ds3_pgsql.tar.gz contains ./ds3/pgsqlds3

To install:

In the directory in which you want to install ds3:
tar -xvzf ds3.tar.gz

and then install the implementation(s) of interest:
tar -xvzf ds3_mysql.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ds3_oracle.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ds3_sqlserver.tar.gz

WinZip may be used to unzip the programs for Windows - ignore the error message

The loader programs use relative addressing to reference the data
files. They will need to be changed if the data files are placed
elsewhere.

DS3 has 3 'standard' sizes:

Database    Size     Customers             Orders   Products
Small      10 MB        20,000        1,000/month     10,000
Medium      1 GB     2,000,000      100,000/month    100,000
Large     100 GB   200,000,000   10,000,000/month  1,000,000

Other sizes are easily created using the utilities described below

ds3.tar.gz contains data files for the Small version.

Most of the directories contain readme's with further instructions


2. What's New in 3

There are some great new changes and enhancements in the DVDStore 3.  Further details about these changes are in this document:

In an effort to make the DVD Store workload more intensive and reflect the
types of things that current real world online store sites are doing, major
changes were made to the DVD Store database and order process for DVD Store 3.
These changes have made the workload profile of DVD Store 3 different from DVD
Store 2.x due to the redefinition of the order process to now include product
reviews and premium membership.  

Product reviews are now part of the DVD Store. Customers of the DVD Store are
now able to write new reviews and view existing reviews for products.
Additionally, users have the ability to rate the helpfulness of a reviews on a
scale from 1 to 10.  There are seven new stored procedures to enable this
functionality.

Premium membership has also been added to the DVD Store, which enables
customers to be able to sign up as bronze, silver, or gold level preimum
member.  

The driver program was updated to simulate users taking advantage of these new
features which results in a new order process.  The new order process is
login/new customer, new preimuim membership signup, browse products by title,
actor, or category, browse product reviews, new product review, new review
helpfulness rating, and finally purchase.

New data generation programs were written to generate load files for the new
reviews, reviews_helpfulness, and membership tables.  

The InstallDVDStore.pl perl script was updated so that it makes calls to the
new data generation programs.

All database build scripts were updated to create the new tables, new stored
procedures, and new indexes.


3. Getting Started Quickly

Simple instructions for building the small DVDStore database using the data 
included in the kit without use of the Perl scripts are given in each 
database directory, for example, .\ds3\sqlserverds3\ds3_sqlserver_readme.txt

This section gives an overview of the steps needed to get a DVDStore of any 
size up and running quickly using the new Perl scripts.

Here is a short list of steps that can get you started quickly. Additional 
details are given later in this document.

	(a) Install database system (OS + Oracle or SQL Server or MySQL)
	(b) Download DVDStore3 to database system
	(c) Ensure that Perl is setup on system
	(d) Run InstallDVDStore.pl
	(e) Use scipts created by InstallDVDStore.pl to create and load database
	(f) On system to be used as driver, run CreateConfigFile.pl
	(g) Run driver program with the parameter file created by CreateConfigFile.pl


4. Prerequisites

In order to run the DVDStore, one of the supported databases (SQL Server, Oracle, 
MySQL, or PostGres) must already be installed and configured.

	4.1 Prerequisites:

		4.1.1	Running Perl scripts on Windows machine:

		In order to be able to run the DS3 Perl scripts on a Windows machine 
		that generate data and build scripts for your database, you need to 
		have Perl installed. The scripts have been tested with Perl from 
		ActiveState and Cygwin

                ActiveState:
                (a)     The free Community Edition may be downloaded at 
			http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads. Select 
                        ActivePerl for the version of Windows you have and run the 
			downloaded file to install Perl

                Cygwin:

		(a)	Download setup.exe from http://www.cygwin.com/ for cygwin installation.
		(b)	Run the installer(setup.exe) to install cygwin.
		(c)	Installer for cygwin will ask for mirrors from which to choose 
			to copy setup files from. 
			(If not successful, retry by selecting another mirror since some 
			of mirrors may not be active)
		(d)	After selecting mirror, installer will ask for which packages to install. 
			(These packages are for emulating some of linux commands including Perl)
		(e)	Select packages for gcc and Perl and their dependent packages. 
			(Or you can just select default package and select Perl checkbox also. 
			 Note: Perl and gcc are not included in default package and must be 
			selected in addition to the defaults.)
                         Note2: gcc is required to generate the best quality data on Windows
		(f)	After the setup is successful, add the cygwin bin folder to the 
			"Path" environment variable.E.g. If cygwin is installed in folder 
			c:\cygwin\ then set path variable as c:\cygwin\bin\
		(g)	Make sure that above steps are successfully completed.
		(h) 	Now you can open cygwin shell and navigate to ds3 directory 
			and run the Perl scripts.
			
			Alternatively you can also run Perl scripts from DOS Shell 
			successfully if you have installed cygwin and Perl.

		4.1.2 The Oracle driver program ds3oracledriver.exe is now compiled with 
		the 64b Oracle 12c Oracle Data Provider for .NET
		

	
5. Using Perl scripts for data generation, build script and configuration file generation

	Perl scripts that automate the task of generating CSV data files are included with 
	DVDStore3. They create database build and cleanup scripts and configuration files 
	which will be used to run the driver program.

	There are two Perl scripts : InstallDVDStore.pl and CreateConfigFile.pl

	5.1	InstallDVDStore.pl

		This Perl script will ask the following:

		(1) Database Size as an integer (User can enter any integer value. For 
		example: 20, 40, 50, 100, 150, etc)
		(2) Database Size in MB/GB   (Defines if the size entered initially was in 
		mb or gb. Possible values are: mb, gb, MB, GB)
		(3) Database Type (User has to specify one of the following values: mssql 
		(for SQL Server), mysql (for MySQL), pgsql (for postgres), or oracle (for Oracle) )
		(4) System OS Type   (User has to specify one of the following values: 
		win (for windows) or linux( for linux) )
		(5) Database file paths (In case of Oracle and SQL Server database, user 
		has to specify paths where the database files for primary dbfile, tables, 
		indexes and log will be stored.

		    	For multiple paths a ';' separated list can be provided. For MySQL 
			database, there is no need to enter this parameter)
			For example the following provides 4 different paths:
					 c:\sql\;d:\sql\;e:\sql\;f:\sql\   

		
		This Perl script generates CSV text files to be used to load as data in the 
		DVD Store database and are structured based on the DVD Store schema.
		These files are stored in the cust, orders, reviews, membership, and prod 
		directories under the data_files directory.  This Perl script also generates 
		customzied build script files for database type selected under the database 
		specific directory.

		The database build scripts are created based on the following set of template 
		files that are included in DVDStore 2.1:

		(1) MySQL

			[1] mysqlds3_cleanup_generic_template.sql - /ds3/mysqlds3/build

		(2) Oracle
			[1] oracleds3_create_all_generic_template.sh - /ds3/oracleds3
			[2] oracleds3_cleanup_generic_fk_disabled_template.sh - /ds3/oracleds3/build
			[3] oracleds3_cleanup_generic_fk_disabled_template.sql - /ds3/oracleds3/build 
			[4] oracleds3_cleanup_generic_template.sh - /ds3/oracleds3/build 
			[5] oracleds3_cleanup_generic_template.sql -  /ds3/oracleds3/build
			[6] oracleds3_create_db_generic_template.sql - /ds3/oracleds3/build
			[7] oracleds3_create_tablespaces_generic_template.sql -	/ds3/oracleds3/build 

		(3) SQL Server
			[1] sqlserverds3_create_all_generic_template.sql - /ds3/sqlserverds3
			[2] sqlserverds3_cleanup_generic_template.sql - /ds3/sqlserverds3/build
			[3] sqlserverds3_create_db_generic_template.sql - /ds3/sqlserverds3/build
			[4] sqlserverds3_create_ind_generic_template.sql - /ds3/sqlserverds3/build

	
		Build script files are generated from template files which have _generic_template 
		in file name.
		The build scripts generated from these template files will be have _databasesize 
		in file name.

		For example: For 20 mb sql server database instance,  a file generated from 
		template file sqlserverds3_create_all_generic_template.sql will be named: 
		sqlserverds3_create_all_20mb.sql

		New scripts are generated in the same folder in which their respective template 
		files reside.

		*Notes : (1) The primary reason that build scripts are created, instead of just 
		directly running the commands, is that the user	can always edit them later. It 
		is very easy to modify these files to account for changing circumstances like 
		changing paths where DBFiles(primary, index or table) or full text index files 
		will be stored. 

		(2) User can also change the default size of DBFile size and default 
		size of increments of growth in case of overflow in size.

		(3) In case of SQL Server database case, user can specify 7 different database 
		file paths for primary dbfile, misc dbfile, customer table, order table dbfile, 
		index dbfile, log file and full text index file respectively. The Template script
		sqlserverds3_create_all_generic_template.sql assumes two dbfiles per table. In 
		case if user wants to change number of dbfiles and file size or paths, user can 
		always edit newly created script.)	
		If user specifies only one path, Perl script will assume same paths for all 
		dbfiles mentioned above and will create database build script with same path 
		name for all dbfiles.
			
		(4) For Oracle, user can specify 4 paths for following tablespaces respectively: 
		customer, index, misc and order. If user specifies only one path, Perl script 
		will assume same paths for all dbfiles mentioned above and will create database
		build script with same path name for all dbfiles.

		(5) All paths should be trailed by following character : \ in case of windows 
		and / in case of Linux.
			For Example: For windows paths can be c:\sql\dbfiles\;d:\sql\dbfiles\
				     For Linux paths can be /sql/dbfiles/

		(6) Multiple paths will always be separated by character ;


		After execution of this Perl script, user can run CreateConfigFile.pl Perl script 
		to generate configuration file used to drive the ds Driver program.

	5.2	CreateConfigFile.pl
	
		This Perl script asks for the following:
			
		(1) Target host(s) (User can enter single or multiple targets to drive workload on. 
		In case of multiple targets, ; character will seperate each target) 
                	(1a) When creating a config file for a web server target, the web server 
			portnumber can be included in the "target" parameter. The format to use 
			for this is <hostname/ip>:<portnumber> where the portnumber is optional.
		(2) Database size (User has to specify the database instance size created on 
		target host specified. For example: 5gb, 20gb, etc. and all the targets be the 
		same size. If different sizes are needed, then mulitple driver programs must be run.)
		(3) Target hostname for perfmon display for windows targets. This is an optional 
		parameter. 
		(4) Target linux machine username,password and IP address or machine name (This 
		parameter uses this format <username>:<password>:<IP Address> 
		For multiple linux targets, semi colon ; seperated list can also be given)
		(5) User has to specify value for detailed_view parameter which is used to show 
		or not to show detailed view of statistics for each target.
			(User has to specify Y (for yes) and N (for No) as an answer)

		This Perl script will create a configuration file named DriverConfig.txt under 
		\ds3 folder. Once this file is created, user can edit this file for parameters 
		like n_threads,run_time, think_time, etc.

6. Running driver programs using configuration file created

	After all above steps and database creation, user can run driver program from command 
	prompt as follows:

	ds3sqlserverdriver.exe --config_file=c:\ds3\DriverConfig.txt

	Driver program can still be run without specifying a config file. Instead user will have 
	to provide all command line parameters to driver program as parameter.

7. Driving workload on multiple target machines: 

	In DVD Store v2.0, driver programs were able to only drive workload against a single 
	machine with a Database Server or Web Server installed. In v2.0, in order to drive 
	workloads on multiple systems with Database or Web Servers installed, multiple 
	instances of driver programs had to be opened and run at same time to drive workload 
	against mulitple machines or targets.

	In DVD Store v2.1, we have modified the Driver programs to be able to distribute 
	the threads equally against multiple target machines specified either on the command 
	line or in a configuration file. 

	In addition to showing the total stats across all targets, the statistics for each 
	individual machine are collected by the driver program and will be displayed on the 
	console based on the "detailed_view" parameter specified in the configuration file. 
	If "detailed_view" parameter is set to value "Y", driver program will print individual 
	as well as aggregate statistics (like opm, response times, CPU%, etc) for each target 
        machine on every 10 seconds interval as well as after the run completes. 

	If value of parameter "detailed_view" is "N", driver program will print aggregate 
	or total statistics after every 10 second interval and print total aggregate as well 
	as individual statistics for each target machine after run completes.

	The prerequisites for driving workload on multiple machines are as follows:
		(1) Each machine has database instance of same size.
		(2) Threads will get spread equally on each machine. e.g. If "n_threads" 
		parameter is set as 2 in configuration file and configuration file has two 
		target machine names, overall 4 threads will be spawned and will spread 
		equally among two machines which is 2 threads per machine.

	Driver program can be run as follows:

	ds3webdriver.exe --config_file=c:\ds3\DriverConfig.txt

	Contents of Config file DrivreConfig.txt will look like as follows:

	target=10.115.66.150;10.115.66.134
	n_threads=4
	ramp_rate=10
	run_time=1
	db_size=5gb
	warmup_time=1
	think_time=0.85
	pct_newcustomers=20
	n_searches=3
	search_batch_size=5
	n_line_items=5
	virt_dir=ds3
	page_type=aspx
	windows_perf_host=10.115.66.150;10.115.66.134
	detailed_view=Y

	Above statement will case web driver to drive workload against two target windows 
	machines with 5gb database instances and spawn 2 threads per machine and print 
	individual as well as aggregate satistics on console.

	For getting linux CPU Utilization data, linux_perf_host parameter must be specified.
	Sample Configfile to run driver against multiple linux targets will look like 
	as follows:
	
	target=10.115.66.150;10.115.66.134
	n_threads=4
	ramp_rate=10
	run_time=1
	db_size=5gb
	warmup_time=1
	think_time=0.85
	pct_newcustomers=20
	n_searches=3
	search_batch_size=5
	n_line_items=5
	virt_dir=ds3
	page_type=php
	linux_perf_host=root:qazwsx:10.115.66.150;root:xswzaq:10.115.66.134
	detailed_view=Y


8. Modifications to Driver Programs:

   8.1  Using custom database size:

	In DVD Store v2.0, driver program was able to drive workload on only standard 
	database sizes S | M | L (10mb | 1gb | 100GB). 	However in current version of 
	DVD Store, we have modified driver program such that it can drive workload on 
	custom database sizes. The database size can be specified by a parameter 
	through configuration file : "db_size". Values of parameter "db_size" can be : 
	S | M | L ( to maintain backward compatibility with standard size databases) 
	or any value of database size like 200mb, 20gb, 150gb, etc.

	In case of driving database workloads on multiple target machines, each machine 
	should have database instance of same size.

   8.2  Parameterization of query for SQL Server driver:
	
	In the case of SQL Server it was discovered that a single querey that is 
	created during the purchase phase of the order was a large percentage of the 
	plan cache.  This was becuase although the query was essentially the same each 
	time, SQL Server did not recognize it as the same and was instead creating a new 
	plan and storing it in the plan cache each time.  By converting the way the 
	query was created so that it was a parameterized query SQL Server then only 
	created a plan once and then reused it for every order.  
	
	This change is significant because it changes the workload for SQL Server from 
	the 2.0 version of the DVD Store.  This change was found to increase the OPM by 
	as much as 20% starting in version 2.1 of DVD Store.  

   8.3  Additional Error Handling
	
	The web driver program was also modified in a couple of places to more 
	gracefully handle unexpected http errors. A max timeout of 60 seconds was added 
	for initial connection of all threads.  If all threads are not connected in 60 
	seconds, the driver program will exit.	


9.  Modifications to Data generation C programs

	In DVD Store v2.0, data generation C programs generate data for standard size 
	instances (S | M | L) only. After generating CSV files, they needed to be converted 
	into proper CR/LF format if they were to be used on a windows system with unix2dos 
	conversion tool.

	In version 2.1 of DVD Store, we have modified C programs to generate CSV files 
	for any database size. Also there is no need to convert	generated CSV files which 
	saves a lot of time for converting huge CSV files into required format.  If you 
	use the InstallDVDStore.pl script the data generation will be run automatically and it 
	will not be necessary to run these commands.  The information is provided here as
	additional detail for those interested.

	Following programs were modified: 

	(1) ds3_create_cust.c
	
		New command line argument is introduced for this c program : n_Sys_Type 
		which denoted system type for which CSV files needs to be generated in 
		correct format.  A 0 for linux and 1 for Windows. 

		This C program can be run as follows: 
		./ds3_create_cust      1  10000 US   S 0 > us_cust.csv &
		./ds3_create_cust  10001  20000 ROW  S 0 > row_cust.csv &

		Above statements will generate customer data file for 10mb instance for 
		linux machine.

	(2) ds3_create_inv.c

		New command line argument is introduced for this c program : n_Sys_Type 
		which denoted system type for which CSV files needs to be generated 
		in correct format. ( 0 for linux and 1 for Windows).

		This C program can be run as follows:
		./ds3_create_inv 10000 0 > ../prod/inv.csv
		
		Above statement will generate inventory data file for 10mb instance 
		for linux machine

	(3) ds3_create_orders.c

		Following new command line arguments are introduced for this C program:

		n_Sys_Type (0 for linux and 1 for windows)
		n_Max_Prod_Id (max product Id for custom database size)
		n_Max_Cust_Id (max customer Id for custom database size)

		This C program can be run as follows:
		./ds3_create_orders     1  1000 jan S  1 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  1001  2000 feb S  2 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  2001  3000 mar S  3 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  3001  4000 apr S  4 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  4001  5000 may S  5 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  5001  6000 jun S  6 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  6001  7000 jul S  7 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  7001  8000 aug S  8 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  8001  9000 sep S  9 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders  9001 10000 oct S 10 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders 10001 11000 nov S 11 0 10000 20000 &
		./ds3_create_orders 11001 12000 dec S 12 0 10000 20000 &
		
		Above stamtents will generate orders data files for 10mb instance for 
		linux mahcine.

	(4) ds3_create_prod.c

		Following command line argument is introduced for this c program:

		n_Sys_Type (0 for linux and 1 for windows)
		
		This C program can be run as follows: 

		
		./ds3_create_prod 10000 0 > prod.csv

		Above statement will generate products data file for 10mb instance for 
		linux machine.

    	NOTE: It is also possible to copy the data files back and forth from Windows 
	to Linux using the text or ascii filetype in programs such as WINSCP

10. Running SQL Server Maintenence Task on SQL Server 2008 
	
	Once the database build and bulk load finishes for SQL Server 2008, in order 
	to get better performance, it is necesary to update statistics of tables in 
	databaes DS2. In previous versions of SQL Server(SQL Server 2005 and 2000), 
	sqlmaint.exec, a command line utility that came with database server 
	installation, was used.  This utility is now obsolete and is no longer 
	included with SQL Server 2008. A maintenence task needs to be created to 
	accomplish the same function in SQL Server 2008.

In SQL Server 2008 Management Studio(GUI), follow following steps:
	1) Go to Object Explorer and click and expand database server tree.
	2) Under server tree, expand management and right click on maintenance plans.
	3) Left Click on "Maintenance Plan Wizard Option".
	4) In the wizard opened, click next and enter name of plan as "ds3".
	5) Click next and check "Update Statistics" checkbox and again click next.
	6) Click next and then choose database as DS2 and click OK.
	7) Ensure "All existing statistics" and "Sample By" checkbox are set along 
	with value "18" "percent".
	8) Once above step is done click next twice to create a task under 
	"Maintenance Plans" under "Management" object under SQL Server tree.
	9) Now right click on this task "ds3" created from above steps and it will 
	show a menu option for right click.
	10)Click execute to update statistics on all tables in DS2 database using 
	task created due to above steps.

For previous versions of SQL Server, user can directly invoke sqlmaint.exe utility 
from command prompt as specified in old documents.

11. Using SpringSource Web Tier for Oracle database testing using web driver
 	
	In DVDStore 2.1, SpringSource MVC Implementation of Web Pages for Oracle 
	database is provided along with old JSP implementation.	If user wants to use 
	SpringSource web tier instead of JSP, here are the steps to ensure Web Tier 
	is setup correctly on Web Server:

	1) To compile SpringSource code, we need JDK to be installed on Web Server 
	preferably JDK 1.6 or later.

	2) After installing set environment variable JAVA_HOME to path where JDK is 
	installed.
		e.g. JAVA_HOME will have value C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\

	3) Also Install Ant to compile SpringSource code using ant build commands.

	4) After installing ant, set ANT_HOME environment variable to path where ant 
	is installed.
		e.g. ANT_HOME will have value C:\apache-ant-1.8.1\

	5) Add similar entries for PATH enviroment variable too.
		e.g. For java, the entry in PATH environment variable will be  
		C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin\
		For ant, the entry in PATH environment variable will be 
		C:\apache-ant-1.8.1\bin\

	6) Install Apache Tomcat Web Server (Version 5.5 or above)

	7) Set CATALINA_HOME environment variable to path where Tomcat is installed.
		e.g. CATALINA_HOME will have value 
		C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\

	8) Download OpenSource SpringSource Framework 2.5.5 from following link:
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/springframework-2/2.5.5/
		(Download Framework with dependencies)
	
	9) Unzip the zip file downloaded in above step in a folder on system on which 
	web server is installed.
		e.g. Unzip above zip file into folder c:\springsource-framework2.5.5\

	10) Go to /ds3/oracleds3/web/springsource/ and copy ds3web folder into webapps 
	directory of Tomcat 5.5 installation directory.
		e.g. Copy ds3web folder in DVDStore 2.1 from 
		C:\ds3\oracleds3\web\springsource\ to 
 		C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ 

	11) Copy following files from SpringSource Framework to ds3web folder in 
	webapps directory of Tomcat i.e. /ds3web/WEB-INF/lib/.

	FileName		CopyFrom Path					CopyTo Path
	spring.jar		C:\springsource-framework2.5.5\dist\spring.jar	C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\
	spring-webmvc.jar 	C:\springsource-framework2.5.5\dist\modules\spring-webmvc.jar		C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\
	standard.jar		C:\springsource-framework2.5.5\lib\jakarta-taglibs\standard.jar		C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\
	commons-logging.jar 	C:\springsource-framework2.5.5\lib\jakarta-commons\commons-logging.jar  C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\
	servlet-api.jar		C:\springsource-framework2.5.5\lib\j2ee\servlet-api.jar			C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\
	jstl.jar		C:\springsource-framework2.5.5\lib\j2ee\jstl.jar			C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\
		
	Also Obtain Oracle J Connector (ojdbc14.jar) 
	from http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html

	Copy ojdbc14.jar to lib folder under ds3web folder in Apache Tomcat webapps. 
	i.e. C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps\ds3web\WEB-INF\lib\

	12) Open command prompt and go to /webapps/ds3web/WEB-INF/ folder under 
	tomcat installation.
	
	13) Type "ant clean" and press enter. (This step will clean up the older 
	*.class files under ds3web folder)
	
	14) Type "ant" and press enter. (This step will build all code under ds3web 
	folder using build.xml file in /ds3web/WEB-INF/ and will dump *.class files 
	in their respective folders)
	
	15) For Web Driver to work for Oracle Web Tier, it is necessary to create two 
	triggers on Database Server. The script to create triggers is located at 
	/ds3/oracleds3/web/springsource/oracleds3_create_trigger_springsource_only.sql
	Run this script on command prompt as: 
	sqlplus ds3/ds3 @oracleds3_create_trigger_springsource_only.sql
	
	16) One build using ant is complete and all above steps are complete, start 
	apache tomcat web server and check whether DVDStore Web tier is up and running 
	using following URL:
		http://<hostname>:8080/dslogin.html
	
	17) Now to run the web driver program and with SpringSource Web pages being 
	hosted by Tomcat, some the parameter values for driver program should be as 
	follows:
		virt_dir=ds3web
		page_type=html
